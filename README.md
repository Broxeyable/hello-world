Hello!

My name is Broxeyable! First, a little about myself. 
I am in my third year of undergraduate college and I am studying (You guessed it!) computer science. 
This repository is my first ever here on GitHub and I am excited to share it. 
My first several repositories are going to be small beginner projects that I have worked on at school and would like to showcase.
The projects are primarily in Python and C and will be fairly simple.
Hopefully, when I learn more I'll be able to post bigger and better projects.
Anyways, thank you for taking the time to read this and stay tuned!

P.S. Moon tacos are the best.
