# hello-world
Hello!

My name is Zack! First, a little about myself. 
I am in my senior year of undergraduate college and I am studying (You guessed it!) computer science. 
This repository is my first ever here on GitHub and I am excited to share it. 
My first several repositories are going to be small beginner projects that I have worked on at school and would like to showcase.
The projects will be in Java and in Assembly. Hopefully, when I learn more I'll be able to post bigger
and better projects. Anyways, thank you for taking the time to read this and stay tuned!

If you'd like to see my REST API project that I worked on for a software engineering course please checkout: https://github.com/team-ramrod-3365/rpgd-api
