# hello-world
Hello!

My name is Zack! First, a little about myself. 
I am in my senior year of undergraduate college and I am studying (You guessed it!) computer science. 
This repository is my first ever here on GitHub and I am excited to share it. 

I am experienced with Java, JavaScript, HTML and CSS with beginner experience in Python and working in both Windows and Linux. Other tools I have experience with are Angular, MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, Docker, Spring, and PostgreSQL. Using these tools I have some academic experience building and implementing REST APIs. 

If you'd like to see my REST API project that I worked on for a software engineering (rpgd-api) and senior capstone (QuestLearn) course please checkout: https://github.com/team-ramrod-3365/rpgd-api and https://github.com/CS4366-QuestLearn/QuestLearn
