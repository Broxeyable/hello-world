Hello!

My name is Broxeyable! First, a little about myself. 
I am in my third year of undergraduate college and I am studying (You guessed it!) computer science. 
This repository is my first ever here on GitHub and I am excited to share it. 
If I understand how this works correctly, this is where I will keep some of my simple projects I have worked on during my studies. 
The projects are primarily in Python and C.
Anyways, thank you for taking the time to read this and stay tuned!

P.S. Moon tacos are the best.
